# Single-View/IBOutlets

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

#### What we are doing
In this lab, we will be recreating the basic Instagram look. You will practice importing images into XCode, adding UI Views to your App, and styling them to spec.


#### Why we are doing it.
As an iOS Developer, in addition to writing code, you will be expected to build user interfaces. Interface Builder is the primary way of creating interfaces in iOS. Knowing how to effectively use interface builder is key to building superb iOS Apps.

## Exercise

### Requirements

+ Create the Interface defined in the [Deliverable](#Deliverable) section
+ Make sure at least one of your labels are defined in code
+ Run the Interface in the Simulator and verify everything looks as expected


### Deliverable

The expected Deliverable should look like this:


<img align="center" src="assets/Deliverable.png" width = "500">



### Bonus Activities

+ Import the "<img src="assets/Heart@1x.png" width="25"></img>" image from the repo's [assets](assets) folder into the assets foldwer in Xcode
+ Add hearts in random places on top of the image
+ Run the App on your iPhone
+ Using the real Instagram App as reference, get the look as close as possible to the original
+ Create a button that changes a label's color
