# Logic Lab

## Introduction

### What we are doing

In this lab, we will create and experiment with XCode Playgrounds.

> ***Note:*** _This Lab is designed to be done independently._


### Why we are doing it

XCode Playgrounds allows you to write and test code quickly and cheaply. This is valuable when you want to learn how to use a new Library, Framework, or Swift feature without having to create an entire App.


## Exercise

### Requirements

+ Create a new Playgrounds Project in XCode

+ Say something about yourself using the `print()` command

+ List and print what languages you know (Human or Computer)

+ Print a quote from your favorite movie

+ Write code that takes the average temperature of the last 5 days in your hometown

+ Solve the following math problems in Swift:
    + Mike drove a total of 178.5 miles in 4 hours. How many miles did he travel after 5 days of the same speed?
    + Josh is a cashier. He can ring up 12 customers in 20 minutes. At this rate, how long would it take for her to ring up 1000 customers?
    + Every day, a group of 9 workers picks pea pods in a field. Each worker picks 2400 pea pods, and each pea pod contains 6 peas. How many peas do the workers pick every day?


### Bonus Activities

+ Show a profile picture of yourself, using a `UIImageView`

+ Show a picture of your favorite place, using a `UIImageView`

+ Show a picture of each planet, including Earth using a `UIImageView`
