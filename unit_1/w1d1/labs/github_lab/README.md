# Github Lab

> ***Note:*** _This homework should be done independently._

## Exercise

By the end of this exercise, you should have the ability to retrieve and submit homework assignments by cloning and pushing to the main TK2 repo.

#### Requirements

- Fork this repository using Github, then clone your fork to your computer. Navigate to this folder. 
- Edit the file in 'starter-code' as instructed in the file.
- Commit your changes to your fork and create a pull request. This is your homework submission.

**Bonus:**
- Bonus: Create a 'branch' on your fork, make and commit a simple change to it, and create a local pull request on your own repository. The change to the your local repository should be a few sentances, in your own words, describing what a 'merge conflict' is and how to resolve one. A link to this PR should be included in the above submission, as specified in the starter-code.


#### Deliverable

Your deliverable is a pull request on the main GA repo that contains your changes to the file in starter-code.
